This is a document which describes this project's coding style.
The purpose of this document is to act as a guide for contributors, and as a reference for internal
style consistency.


PHILOSOPHY:
1. Your code's style should strive to be as explicit as possible. Explicit is better than implicit.
2. Your code isn't measured by how short it is. Don't be afraid to go for longer solutions if they
are more easy to read and understand. Long and easy is better than short and hard.
3. Prefer namespaces functions to classes.


INDENTATION:
You should indent your code with tabs of size 4.
Try to indent things to match the same indentation level, like this:
	gdt_entries[entry].base_low     = (base & 0xFFFF);
    gdt_entries[entry].base_middle  = (base >> 16) & 0xFF;
    gdt_entries[entry].base_high    = (base >> 24) & 0xFF;
When things appear on the same line, the eye doesn't have to move alot, making code easier to read.
Place 2 new lines between each function/class


NAMING:
Each different construct of C++ has a different naming convention, for easy distiction.
	Macros: 	should be written in ALL_CAPS.
	Classes: 	should be written in PascalCase
	Namespaces:	shpuld be written in camelCase
	Enums: 		should be written in Camel_Case_With_Underscores
	Functions:	should be written in snake_case
	Type defs: 	should be written in snake_case_with_t (if type def is for struct)
This way, each time you see a name, you can quickly know which concept it refers to.

In classes, private and protected members whould be prefixed with 'm_', to indicated they are private.
Static global variables should be prefixed with '_', to indicate they are private to the file.
Static functions should be prefixed with '__', to indicate they are private to the file.

Regular header files, without any definitions (only declerations), should be postfixed with ".h"
Header files that contain some sort of definition should be postfixed with ".hpp"

BRACKETS:
The brackets for each new scope should we written in different lines, for functions, classes,
enums, loops, and conditions alike, for example:
	void func()
	{

	}

	class Object
	{

	}

	for(;;)
	{

	}

The exception to this rule are namespaces, where the macro NAMESPACE_BEGIN and NAMESPACE_END should be 
used instead of naked namespace declerations.


CLASSES VS REGULAR FUNCTIONS:
Always prefer namespaced functions to classes with member functions, even if they are static.
For example, this:
	
	namespace tty {
		void func()
	}

is much better than this:

	class tty {
		static void func()
	}


CLASSES & STRUCTS:
Prefer to use structs over classes. 
Classes should be used as objects (that is, as a way to combine code and data). Dont write classes
if you don't have to.
Structs should be written as C-style structs, that is, without any member functions. 
Access levels for classes should be written like this:
	class Object
	{
	public:
		void func();

	protected:
		void _foo();

	private:
		void _bar();
	}
Never make a member variable public, always use getters and setters! This is done for future proofing,
as you never know if you might start encapsulating the member variables. If you start making them public
now and private later, you'll have to manualy change all your code to use the getters and setters instead
of naked class access. 
When classes inherit from each other, never forget to write "override" and virtual. Remember, explicit
is better than implicit!


NAMESPACES:
You should use the macros NAMESPACE_BEGIN and NAMESPACE_END, defined in kernel/kdef.h.
You should define namespaces only in header files. In the implementation file, you will access
the namespaces like this:
	// gdt.h
	NAMESPACE_BEGIN(gdt)
		void func()
	NAMESPACE_END(gdt)

	//gdt.cpp
	gdt::func() ...



ENUMS:
Always prefer using an enum class to a regular enum.
If you can, specify the type of the enum.
Each value should be written in a separate line, unless the enum is defined localy inside of a
function (which you should strive to avoid).

	// Good!
	enum class Colors : uint8_t
	{
		Red,
		Green, 
		Blue
	}
	...
	Colors::Red

	// BAD!
	enum COLORS { RED, GREEN, BLUE }
